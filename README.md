# hello-world
This is my first repo on github.

I am active in Robotics stuff like micro-controllers, micro-processors, sensors and control systems related to these core components of Robotics which lead to automation of the system. I've worked on hardware as well as software side of projects like motion planning, odometry, navigation and waypoint guidance algorithms of omni-wheeled robots and quadrotors.
